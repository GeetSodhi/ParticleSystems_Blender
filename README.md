### ASSIGNMENT 1 :  PARTICLE SYSTEMS






This Blender project showcases the interaction between particle systems and wind force fields, resulting in a captivating visual spectacle. With careful attention to detail, I've crafted an animation featuring 10,000 particles gracefully responding to the influence of the wind force field.

The animation portrays a harmonious dance, where particles elegantly glide and swirl in accordance with the dynamic forces at play. Through meticulous choreography, the interplay between particles and the wind force field is brought to life


Presented in MP4 format, this animation serves as a testament to the versatility and creative potential of Blender's particle systems. It invites viewers to appreciate the seamless integration of physics and artistry, culminating in a professional and visually engaging experience.
